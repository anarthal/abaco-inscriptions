ABACO yearly organizes a four-day event that encounters many people with the
same hobby. ABACO maintains several online forms to help participants and
collaborators communicate with the organization. This WordPress plugin
provides these forms and the necessary admin pages to manage them.

Four contact forms are implemented: two for online inscriptions of participants;
one for collaborators to register activities to be performed during the event;
and one to register online to some activities.

The plugin is built on the top of Contact Form 7 (https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/).
